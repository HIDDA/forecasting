Description: The forthcoming Handbook of Infectious Disease Data Analysis (HIDDA)
    contains a chapter on "Forecasting Based on Surveillance Data".
    The R package 'HIDDA.forecasting' provides the data and code to reproduce
    results from the two applications described in the book
    (see the corresponding vignettes):
    First, a univariate analysis of Swiss ILI counts using modelling
    techniques from various R packages (including 'forecast', 'prophet'
    and 'surveillance').
    Second, an age-stratified analysis of Berlin norovirus counts
    using the multivariate time-series model "hhh4" from 'surveillance'.
