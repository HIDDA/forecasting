Description: The Handbook of Infectious Disease Data Analysis ("HIDDA")
    contains a chapter on "Forecasting Based on Surveillance Data".
    The R package 'HIDDA.forecasting' provides the data and code to reproduce
    results from the two applications described in that chapter
    (see the corresponding vignettes):
    Univariate forecasting of Swiss ILI counts using 'forecast', 'glarma',
    'surveillance' and 'prophet',
    and an age-stratified analysis of norovirus counts in Berlin
    using the multivariate time-series model "hhh4" from 'surveillance'.
