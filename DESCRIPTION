Description: Part V of the Handbook of Infectious Disease Data Analysis
    deals with the analysis of surveillance data, covering point process
    methods, discrete-time spatial models, prospective cluster detection,
    issues of underreporting and reporting delays, Bayesian models for
    disease incidence and transmission, and, last but not least, a chapter
    on epidemic forecasting. This package contains data and code to
    reproduce results from this last chapter.
