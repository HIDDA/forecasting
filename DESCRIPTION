Description: The Handbook of Infectious Disease Data Analysis (HIDDA)
    contains several chapters about the analysis of surveillance data (part V).
    This includes point process methods,
    discrete-time spatial models,
    prospective cluster detection,
    issues of underreporting and reporting delays,
    Bayesian models for disease incidence and transmission,
    and, last but not least, a chapter on epidemic forecasting.
    This R package contains data and code to reproduce results
    from the presented univariate analysis of Swiss ILI counts
    and the age-stratified analysis of Berlin norovirus counts.
